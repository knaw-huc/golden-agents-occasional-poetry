## Introduction



During the course of the 17th century, social events like a birth, death, or an upcoming marriage seem to have stimulated creative production. In the case of a marriage there are for instance song books given to each other during the period of courtship (Grootes 1987), poems written for the wedding day (Geerdink and Lassche 2020), and small song books ('mops') to be handed out on the wedding day (Grijp 1996). 

In this case study we dive into these creative industries surrounding the production of occasional poetry and take a closer look the relation between social habits, networks, and creative production in art and literature. Doing so, we hope to gain more insight in:

1. The dynamics of production and consumption: who made what for whom, and with whom, and where? 
2. The dynamics of artistic creativity: what products were invented, with what content, what purpose, what style, what intertextuality?
