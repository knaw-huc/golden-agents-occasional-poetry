Experimental results for a range of different threshold and k values.

The k parameter governs how many nearest neighbors are found for each entity in the first stage of the algorithm. 
For example, with k = 10, then for each entity we find the 10 nearest entities in the embedding, using Euclidean distance.

The threshold parameter denotes a minimum cosine similarity and decides which nearest neighbors are considered candidates for being duplicates. 
For example, of the 10 nearest neighbors, only 5 may have a cosine similarity larger or equal to the threshold. After this is done, we have
obtained a set of candidate pairs. A lower threshold will yield more candidate pairs. We can construct a graph from these candidate pairs. 
This graph will usually consist of a number of connected components. These components tend to be larger with lower thresholds.

Furthermore, the threshold parameter is also used in the process of splitting up the components into smaller clusters. Afterwards each cluster
is considered to represent a single real life entity. During clustering, we subtract the threshold from all computed similarities inside a connected component.
Again, smaller thresholds will generally yield larger clusters, and visa versa.
